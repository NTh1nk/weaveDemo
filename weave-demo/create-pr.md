## Title
feat: add Remember Me functionality to login form

## Description

This PR adds a "Remember Me" feature to the login form, improving user experience by allowing users to save their username for future logins.

### Changes Made

- **Login Form Enhancement**: Added a "Remember Me" checkbox to the login form
- **Local Storage Integration**: Username is saved to localStorage when checkbox is checked
- **Auto-fill Functionality**: Username is automatically filled on subsequent visits if previously remembered
- **Visual Indicator**: Added a small ðŸ’¾ icon in the dashboard when user was remembered
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated feature lists to include the new functionality

### Technical Details

- Uses `localStorage` for persistent storage
- Implements `useEffect` to load remembered username on component mount
- Adds proper CSS styling for the checkbox to match existing design
- Includes hover effects and proper accessibility

### Testing

1. Login with "admin" / "password"
2. Check "Remember me" checkbox
3. Logout and return to login page
4. Username should be pre-filled and checkbox should be checked
5. Login again and verify the ðŸ’¾ indicator appears in dashboard

### Screenshots

The login form now includes a "Remember me" checkbox below the password field, styled to match the existing design.
